gug_A,gug,yes,"Guarani does not have a clear morphological class of adjectives. Most roots that can be used as adjectives do so without any specific marking that would distinguish them from verbs or nouns (Estigarribia: 2020, p. 87). Such bare roots are categorized into this section. Bare roots cannot function as independent predicates (gug_ex_05), they must take verbal personal markers in such situations (gug_ex_06)."

gug_N_A,gug,yes,"As modifiers, bare roots can only be postnominal and they can not take dependents."

gug_V,gug,yes,"This section deals with nominal modifiers in which roots are marked with a verbal agreement prefixe and the adjectivizer/relativizer -va (unmarked for tense), -va'ekue (adjectivizing in the past) and -va'er√£ (adjectivizing in the future). Forms with the suffix -va (adjectivizer/relativizer) cannot be used predicatively."
