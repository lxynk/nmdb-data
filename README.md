Guidelines for the creation of (raw) `*-examples.csv` and `*-values.csv` tables:
1. new language => new branch
2. no spaces in first row
3. rap the content of the cell in ""/'' if it contains a comma
4. do not put '' around the translation, it will be done automatically during the conversion
5. *? intended? placement of '' in ungrammatical examples?
6. {} for a missing element in the gloss?
7. square brackets with category subscripts?
8. multiple parameters: space separated
