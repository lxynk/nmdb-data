mya_A,mya,no,"No clear class of adjectives can be postulated in Burmese. What are adjectives in English mostly function as verbs in Burmese. Instead of adjectives, they are a class of stative verbs (or property verbs) in Burmese, with the same syntactic possibilities as other verbs (Jenny & Hnin Tun, 2016, p. 9). Another type of construction, the most challenging one in terms of form and function, consists of a noun and a postnominal verb in nominalized form (Jenny, 2022, p. 163)."

mya_N_V,mya,no,"REL clauses in Burmese can never be placed after the noun, not even as an after-thought. The REL marker (creaky tone on the NFUT or FUT marker) marks dependence on the following element, so there must necessarily follow a head noun (Mathias Jenny, p.c.)."
