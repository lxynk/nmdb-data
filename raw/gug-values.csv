gug_A,gug,yes,"Guaraní does not have a clear morphological class of adjectives: most roots that can be used as adjectives do so without any specific marking that would distinguish them from verbs or nouns (Estigarribia 2020: p. 87). Bare roots can function as noun modifiers; in this function, they can only be postnominal and cannot take dependents."

gug_V,gug,yes,"This section deals with nominal modifiers in which roots are marked with a verbal agreement prefixe and the adjectivizer/relativizer -va (unmarked for tense), -va'ekue (adjectivizing in the past) and -va'erã (adjectivizing in the future). Forms with the suffix -va (adjectivizer/relativizer) cannot be used predicatively."
