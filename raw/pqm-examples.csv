The distribution of proximate and obviative forms indicate that the head is clause-internal when it occupies the right periphery of the clause. In other words, apparent right-headed relative clauses are actually internally headed clauses. "

If the head could be external, then the example should have been acceptable, which is not the case here.

This is a mixed type of structure for NP that include a relative clause. In this example, the head of the relative clause must be internal. The head is obviate while the n-tátat ""my fater"" is proximate. This proximate demonstrative appears in clause-initial position, but must be external to the relative clause itself."
