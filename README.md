Guidelines for the creation of raw tables:
1. new language => new branch
2. file names: `*-examples.csv` and `*-values.csv`
3. no spaces in first row
4. wrap the content of the cell in '' if it contains a comma
5. multiple parameters associated to an example: space separated
6. do not put '' around the translation (will be added automatically)
7. [?] *? "Intended:"? placement of '' in ungrammatical examples?
8. [?] use {} for missing elements in the gloss?
9. [?] category subscripts and other markup?

Notes on parameters:
- set of modifiers: does not include numerals, demonstratives, articles
- set of dependents: does not include degree modifiers

Notes on values:
1. yes, no, special, unknown (+ lack of value = does not apply)
2. some examples of 'special':
- lexically restricted yes (e.g. prenominal adjectives in Abkhaz or Basque)
- constructionally restricted yes (e.g. only superlatives as prenominal modifiers in Farsi)
- special prosodic properties: prosodic break (e.g. postnominal modifiers in Chinese)
- special prosodic properties: focal stress (e.g. preadjectival dependents in Russian)
- unclear what the split is conditioned by (e.g. adnominal PPs in Guarani)
3. possible values of a subordinate parameter if the value of the superordinate parameter is:
- yes: any value
- no: lack of value (does not apply)
- special: ?
