gug_A,gug,A,yes,A-yes,"Guaraní does not have a clear morphological class of adjectives: most roots that can be used as adjectives do so without any specific marking that would distinguish them from verbs or nouns (Estigarribia 2020: p. 87). Bare roots can function as noun modifiers; in this function, they can only be postnominal and cannot take dependents. However, bare roots cannot function as independent predicates, they must take verbal personal markers (prefixes) to be able to do so.",,gug_ex_01 gug_ex_06 gug_ex_16
