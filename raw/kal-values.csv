kal_A_attr,kal,special,"There is no morphological category of adjective in West Greenlandic. Adjectival function is served by a subset of (stative) verbal and nominal bases (Fortescue_1984, p. 204). But there are a few nominals which are principally adjectival (Fortescue_1984, p. 108). There are also a few affixes which function as nominal extenders, thus having a ‘adjectival’ meaning (Fortescue_1984, p. 317)."
