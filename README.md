Guidelines for the creation of raw tables:
1. new language => new branch
2. file names: `*-examples.csv` and `*-values.csv`
3. no spaces in first row
4. wrap the content of the cell in '' if it contains a comma
5. multiple parameters associated to an example: space separated
6. do not put '' around the translation (will be added automatically)
7. [?] *? "Intended:"? placement of '' in ungrammatical examples?
8. [?] use {} for missing elements in the gloss?
9. [?] category subscripts and other markup?

Notes on parameters:
- set of modifiers: does not include numerals, demonstratives, articles
- set of dependents: does not include degree modifiers
