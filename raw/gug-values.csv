gug_A,gug,yes,"Guarani does not have a clear morphological class of adjectives. Most roots that can be used as adjectives do so without any specific marking that would distinguish them from verbs or nouns (Estigarribia: 2020, p. 87). Such bare roots are categorized into this section. As modifiers, they can only be postnominal and they can not take dependents."
