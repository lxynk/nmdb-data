Guidelines for the creation of (raw) `*-examples.csv` and `*-values.csv` tables:
1. no spaces in first row
2. rap the content of the cell in ""/'' if it contains a comma
3. do not put '' around the translation, it will be done automatically during the conversion
4. *? intended? placement of '' in ungrammatical examples?
5. {} for a missing element in the gloss?
6. square brackets with category subscripts?
7.
